# Accessrank

Marketing site and live accessibility audit service for a WCAG 2.2 AA remediation
business selling to DTC ecommerce brands.

> **Picking this up cold?** Read [`docs/HANDOFF.md`](docs/HANDOFF.md) first. It
> covers why the design decisions are what they are, and documents six bugs that
> produced no error message at all — including one that silently disabled the
> per-IP quota for every IPv6 visitor while all the tests stayed green.

One Node process serves the static marketing site **and** the audit API. One
`docker run` gives you the whole product.

## The investor deck (`/deck`)

`/deck` is the source for `accessrank-deck` (originally its own repo, folded in
here so both live in one place). It's a separate Vite app with its own
`package.json` and dependencies — it does not build as part of `npm run build`
above, and the two apps do not share `node_modules`.

The main site serves the deck's **prebuilt static output**, already committed
at `src/assets/static/deck/`. `build.mjs`'s existing static-file copy step
picks that up with no code changes, so it lands at `dist/deck/` and is reachable
at `/deck/` once deployed. The main site's nav ("How it works") opens it in a
full-screen overlay via an `<iframe src="/deck/">`; see `.deck-overlay` in
`src/assets/css/components.css` and the deck-overlay block in `src/assets/js/site.js`.

**If you edit anything under `/deck`,** rebuild and re-vendor it before your
next deploy:

```
cd deck
npm install
DECK_BASE=/deck/ npm run build
rm -rf ../src/assets/static/deck
cp -r dist ../src/assets/static/deck
```

Then `npm run build` at the repo root as usual — the new deck output is picked
up automatically. `/deck`'s own README covers its build, its asset pipeline,
and the two hosted copies it used to deploy to on its own (both now superseded
by this repo, if you're publishing from here going forward).

## What it does

A visitor enters their store URL in the hero. The server loads that page in real
headless Chromium, runs **axe-core** against WCAG 2.2 Level AA, extracts on-page
SEO signals from the same page load, scores it, and shows the result immediately.

If they want the full report, a small modal collects **name, email and phone**.
That lead is written to Postgres alongside the complete scan result, a PDF is
generated, and it is **emailed** to the address they gave.

### Why the PDF is email-only

It is never offered as a browser download. That single decision is what makes
"one report per email address" enforceable — a throwaway address yields no
report — and it is the entire point of the lead capture.

---

## Quick start

```bash
npm install
npm run setup      # installs Chromium, self-hosts fonts, generates images, builds
npm start          # http://localhost:3000
```

That works with **no configuration at all**. Without `DATABASE_URL` the app uses
an in-memory store, and without `RESEND_API_KEY` emails are written to the log
instead of sent — so you can exercise the entire funnel locally, including the
quotas, before you have any accounts.

Try the scanner from the command line:

```bash
npm run scan -- https://example.com
npm run scan -- --fixture broken     # a deliberately broken storefront
npm run preview:pdf                  # writes report-preview.pdf
```

---

## How the score works

Documented in full at `/methodology`, because the PDF cites it.

**Accessibility — a conformance-criterion pass rate.** axe rules are grouped onto
the WCAG success criteria they test. A criterion is met or it is not; weight is
Level A = 3, Level AA = 2, best practice = 1.

```
score = weighted criteria met / weighted criteria evaluated x 100
```

It is deliberately **not** element-weighted. Under an element-weighted model a
storefront with no page title, no `lang` attribute, five images without alt text
and an unlabelled form scored **75** — because thousands of unrelated elements
happened to pass other checks. That understates real legal exposure to a buyer.
Under the criterion model the same page scores **39**. Failing SC 1.1.1 on five
images means you fail 1.1.1; passing markup elsewhere does not earn it back.

Element counts are still reported — they indicate the *size of the remediation
job*, not the score.

**SEO** — a weighted checklist of 14 on-page signals from the same page load.
**Overall** — 60% accessibility, 40% SEO.

Items axe cannot decide without a human count half. A site with nothing
measurable is reported as unscored, never as 100.

## Abuse protection

| Rule | Where enforced |
|---|---|
| 1 emailed report per email address, ever | `leads.email_normalized` UNIQUE + a locked transaction |
| 3 report requests per IP per rolling 24h | `rate_events` + `pg_advisory_xact_lock` |
| 8 scans per IP per rolling 24h | same |
| 3 scans per IP per minute | `express-rate-limit` |
| 24h per-origin scan cache | cache hits cost nothing and do not consume quota |

**Email normalization matters.** `carlos+promo@gmail.com`, `c.a.r.l.o.s@gmail.com`
and `CARLOS@googlemail.com` all collapse to `carlos@gmail.com`, so plus-tagging
cannot buy a second report. Gmail dot-stripping applies only to Gmail, where dots
genuinely are insignificant.

**IPv6 is normalized to the /64 prefix.** ISPs delegate a /64 per subscriber, so
counting full IPv6 addresses would make the per-IP quota meaningless.

**IP identity fails closed.** An address that cannot be parsed maps to a shared
bucket, never to "no limit". A pre-launch audit found the opposite: `clientIp()`
returned an already-normalized value and the routes normalized it a second time,
which turned every IPv6 `/64` string into `null` — and because the quota code
guards with `if (ipHash)`, that silently disabled the per-IP cap for every IPv6
visitor. The IPv4 tests passed the whole time. There are now HTTP-level tests
asserting the cap over IPv6 and across address rotation inside one `/64`.

**IPs are never stored in the clear** — only an HMAC-SHA256 keyed with
`IP_HASH_SALT`. Equality-comparable, not reversible. Rotating that salt resets
every quota, so treat it as permanent.

Quotas are consumed inside a transaction holding locks on both the email and the
IP, acquired in sorted order so concurrent requests cannot deadlock. The tests
fire 12 simultaneous same-email requests and assert exactly one wins.

If delivery fails on our side, the quota is **refunded** — an outage at the mail
provider must not burn the visitor's one allowed report.

Also active: Cloudflare Turnstile, a hidden honeypot field, and a minimum
form-completion time. Bot-trapped submissions receive a fake success response
rather than an error, so a script learns nothing.

---

## SSRF

The scanner fetches attacker-supplied URLs, so `server/lib/ssrf.js` is a real
security boundary, not a formality. Blocked: every spelling of loopback
(`127.1`, `0177.0.0.1`, `2130706433`, `[::1]`, `[::ffff:127.0.0.1]`), all RFC1918
and CGNAT ranges, `169.254.169.254` and the cloud metadata hostnames, IPv6
tunnels that embed a private IPv4 (`64:ff9b::`, `2002::`), non-HTTP schemes,
credentials in the URL, non-standard ports, and internal-looking suffixes.

Checks run at three points: before navigation (parse + DNS, requiring **every**
A/AAAA answer to be public), on every redirect hop and subresource request, and
against the socket's actual peer IP after the response — which is what closes the
DNS-rebinding window. Error messages never reveal whether an internal host exists.

`SCAN_ALLOW_PRIVATE` exists so integration tests can scan a loopback fixture. It
is ANDed with `!isProd` in config, so it cannot weaken a deployed instance even
if set.

## Commands

| Command | What it does |
|---|---|
| `npm run build` | Build the static site into `dist/` |
| `npm start` / `npm run dev` | Serve site + API |
| `npm test` | Unit + integration tests |
| `npm run test:a11y` | **Audit our own site with axe-core; fails on any violation** |
| `npm run test:links` | Fail if any internal link is dead |
| `npm run verify` | All of the above |
| `npm run migrate` | Apply SQL migrations |
| `npm run fonts` / `npm run images` | Regenerate self-hosted fonts / brand images |

`npm run test:a11y` runs every built page through axe-core at desktop and mobile
viewports and fails on a single violation. A company selling WCAG conformance
cannot ship a marketing site that fails it.

---

## Deploying

Secrets are never baked into the image. `SITE_URL` **is** baked in at build time
because it appears in canonical tags and the sitemap.

```bash
fly launch --no-deploy
fly secrets set \
  DATABASE_URL="postgres://..." \
  RESEND_API_KEY="re_..." \
  IP_HASH_SALT="$(node -e "console.log(require('crypto').randomBytes(32).toString('hex'))")" \
  TURNSTILE_SECRET_KEY="0x..." \
  ADMIN_TOKEN="$(node -e "console.log(require('crypto').randomBytes(24).toString('base64url'))")"
fly deploy
fly ssh console -C "node scripts/migrate.mjs"
```

Set `TURNSTILE_SITE_KEY` in `fly.toml` under `[build.args]` — it is public and
must be present at build time to render into the forms.

The same image runs on Render, Railway, or any VPS. Give it **2GB of RAM**:
Chromium will be OOM-killed mid-scan on 512MB.

In production the app **refuses to boot** without `DATABASE_URL`, `IP_HASH_SALT`,
`RESEND_API_KEY`, `ADMIN_TOKEN`, both Turnstile keys, and an `https://` `SITE_URL`.
That is deliberate — a deploy that silently drops leads or runs without bot
defence is worse than one that fails loudly. Turnstile in particular produces no
visible symptom when missing, so it is a boot failure rather than a warning;
`ALLOW_NO_CAPTCHA=1` is the explicit opt-out.

---

## Getting the leads out

```bash
curl -H "Authorization: Bearer $ADMIN_TOKEN" \
  "https://accessrank.ai/api/admin/leads?format=csv" -o leads.csv
```

Columns: date, client name, email, phone, company, website, source, overall /
accessibility / SEO scores, violation counts, pages scanned, marketing opt-in,
consent timestamp, and delivery status — everything the brief asked to be
recorded. In SQL it is the `lead_export` view.

Values beginning `=`, `+`, `-` or `@` are prefixed with an apostrophe so a
malicious lead cannot inject a spreadsheet formula into a file an operator opens.

---

## Things that were deliberately removed

- **The fake hero scan.** The original ran a simulated audit of `example.shop`
  800ms after page load, for every visitor, with hardcoded results identical for
  any URL entered. It is now a real scan that only runs when asked.
- **The fabricated testimonial.** "Henry Lovejoy, FresheMeals.com" — no photo, no
  link, unverifiable. Social proof is now config-gated
  (`FEATURE_TESTIMONIALS`) and stays off until real, attributable quotes exist.
- **The signup password field.** It was required, validated, then silently
  discarded; no account was created. Collecting a credential that goes nowhere is
  a liability. The page is now honestly a lead form.
- **Web3Forms.** Both forms POSTed to a third party with a hardcoded key. They now
  post to `/api/lead`.
- **Google Fonts CDN.** It sent every visitor's IP to Google on page load, which a
  German court has held unlawful under the GDPR — awkward for a compliance
  product, and undisclosed in its own privacy policy. Fonts are self-hosted.
- **Eleven dead links**, including four footer `href="#"` placeholders repeated on
  every page and four job listings that all pointed at the pricing anchor.
  `npm run test:links` now makes that class of defect a build failure.

## Known limitations

Stated here and on `/methodology` because the product is sold on honesty about risk.

- Automated testing detects roughly **a third to a half** of real accessibility
  barriers. It cannot judge whether alt text is *meaningful*, whether focus order
  is *logical*, or whether an error message is *helpful*. A conformance claim
  requires manual and assistive-technology testing.
- The free check reads up to 3 pages. A storefront's real debt is spread across
  product, collection and checkout templates.
- A good score is not a legal guarantee, and nothing here is legal advice.
